# Freex
**Free experience** is the full name of this application. The idea of this application is very similar to a simplified version of "freelancing", but without commerce. Each user can set his own task, as well as perform someone else's tasks. For each completed task, he receives points that increase his level.

The purpose of this project is to help people **gain experience** and also **create a process of helping** each other
